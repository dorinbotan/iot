## Case 1: IoT Platform Basic {#section_fml_g2b_5db .section}

Your device sends one 0.4 KB message every second to IoT Platform. IoT Platform then delivers this message to five other devices and one application. In this case, five devices and one application will receive this message. For this scenario, we assume one month equals 30 days.

Your fees are calculated as follows:

0.4 KB < 0.5 KB, so each 0.4 KB message is counted as one message.

Messages sent per month: 1 message/second \* 60 seconds/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 2,592,000 messages.

Messages received per month: 6 messages/second \* 60 seconds/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 15,552,000 messages.

Total messages: 2,592,000 + 15,552,000 = 18,144,000 messages.

The first 1,000,000 messages of each month are free. Therefore, the actual chargeable message count is calculated as follows: 18,144,000 - 1,000,000 =17,144,000.

The fee is USD 0.8 per 1,000,000 messages, and the total fee is calculated as \(USD 0.8/1,000,000\) \* 17,144,000 = USD 13.72.

## Case 2: IoT Platform Basic {#section_xqz_j2b_5db .section}

Your device sends one 0.6 KB message every second to IoT Platform. IoT Platform then stores this message to Table Store. For this scenario, we assume one month equals 30 days.

Your fees are calculated as follows:

0.5 KB \*2 \> 0.6 KB \>0.5 KB, so each 0.6 KB message is counted as two messages.

Messages sent per month: 2 messages/second \* 60 seconds/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 5,184,000 messages.

After you enable the Table Store service, fees are charged for using Table Store. If you use the rules engine to forward messages to Table Store, IoT Platform does not charge for data transfer to Table Store.

The first 1,000,000 messages of each month are free. Therefore, the actual chargeable message count is calculated as follows: 5,184,000 - 1,000,000 = 4,184,000.

The fee is USD 0.8 per 1,000,000 messages, and the total fee is calculated as \(USD 0.8/1,000,000\) \* 4,184,000 = USD 3.35.

## Case 3: IoT Platform Basic {#section_r4q_42b_5db .section}

Your application device sends one 0.5 KB message every minute to IoT Platform. IoT Platform then delivers this message to 10 other devices. In this case, 10 devices will receive this message and then the message will be stored to Table Store. 

Your fees are calculated as follows:

The message is 0.5 KB. Therefore, each message is counted as one message.

Messages sent per month: 1 message/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 43,200 messages.

Messages received per month: 10 messages/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 432,000 messages.

After you enable the Table Store service, fees are charged for using Table Store. If you use the rules engine to forward messages to Table Store, IoT Platform does not charge for data transfer to Table Store.

Total messages: 43,200 + 432,000 = 475,200 messages.

No fees apply, because the total message count \(sent and received\) does not exceed the free monthly message quota of 1,000,000.

## Case 4: IoT Platform Basic {#section_g5r_q2b_5db .section}

The server sends one 0.6 KB request every minute to IoT Platform by calling the Revert-RPC interface. IoT Platform then delivers the request to your device. Your device accepts the request and replies one 0.4 KB response to IoT Platform. IoT Platform then delivers the response to the server. 

The fees are calculated as follows:

0.5 KB \*2 \> 0.6 KB \>0.5 KB, so each 0.6 KB message is counted as two messages.

Each response message, which is 0.4 KB, is counted as one message.

Messages sent per month:

-   Server \(Requests\): 2 messages/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 86,400 messages.
-   Device \(Responses\): 1 message/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 43,200 messages.

Total messages: 86,400 + 43,200 = 129,600 messages.

No fees apply, because the total message count \(sent and received\) does not exceed the free monthly message quota of 1,000,000.

## Case 5: IoT Platform Pro {#section_zpg_vkn_42b .section}

Billing items of IoT Platform Pro include message \(sent and received\) fee and device management fee.

Your device sends one 0.4 KB message every second to IoT Platform. IoT Platform then delivers this message to five other devices and one application. In this case, five devices and one application will receive this message. For this scenario, we assume one month equals 30 days.

Billing items:

-   Message communication fee

    0.4 KB < 0.5 KB, so each 0.4 KB message is counted as one message.

    Messages sent per month: 1 message/second \* 60 seconds/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 2,592,000 messages.

    Messages received per month: 6 messages/second \* 60 seconds/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 15,552,000 messages.

    Total messages: 2,592,000 + 15,552,000 = 18,144,000 messages.

    The first 1,000,000 messages of each month are free. Therefore, the actual chargeable message count is calculated as follows: 18,144,000 - 1,000,000 =17,144,000.

    The fee is USD 0.8 per 1,000,000 messages, and the total fee is calculated as \(USD 0.8/1,000,000\) \* 17,144,000 = USD 13.72.

-   Device management fee

    The amount of living device is six \(one device sends messages and five devices receive messages\) . Because every Alibaba Cloud account has a free quota of ten living devices each day, no device management fee is charged.


The total fee is calculated as USD 13.72 + USD 0 = USD 13.72.

## Case 6: IoT Platform Pro {#section_u3v_npn_42b .section}

Your device sends one 0.4 KB message every second to IoT Platform. IoT Platform then delivers this message to 20 other devices. For this scenario, we assume one month equals 30 days.

Billing items:

-   Message communication fee

    0.4 KB < 0.5 KB, so each 0.4 KB message is counted as one message.

    Messages sent per month: 1 message/second \* 60 seconds/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days = 2,592,000 messages.

    Messages received per month: 20 messages/second \* 60 seconds/minute \* 60 minutes/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days =51,840,000 messages.

    Total messages: 2,592,000 + 51,840,000 = 54,432,000 messages.

    The first 1,000,000 messages of each month are free. Therefore, the actual chargeable message count is calculated as follows: 54,432,000 - 1,000,000 = 53,432,000 messages.

    The fee is USD 0.8 per 1,000,000 messages, and the total message fee is calculated as \(USD 0.8/1,000,000\) \* 53,432,000 = USD 42.75.

-   Device management fee

    The amount of living device is 21 \(one device sends messages and 20 devices receive messages\) . Because every Alibaba Cloud account has a free quota of ten living devices each day, the amount of devices to be charged for device management fee is:  21 - 10 = 11 devices.

    The device management fee is USD 0.003 for each living device per day.

    The total device management fee for a month is calculated as: 11 devices \* USD 0.003 \* 30 days = USD 0.99.


The total fee for a month is: USD 42.75 + USD 0.99 = USD 43.74.
